My partner and I spent our wedding night at the Landmark and it was an overall brilliant stay.
The staff were super attentive and very courteous, making sure our stay was as nice as possible.
The hotel itself is such an opulent building and the courtyard speaks VOLUMES! Its an amazing space to catch up with friends and go for a causal drink after work.
Room Service was great too...you could get a steak delivered to your room at 2AM!
Although the hotel does not have parking, there is an underground car park about a 5 minute walk away, so its pretty convenient.
