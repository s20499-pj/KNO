Disliked Â· The overhead shower didn't work. The water didn't come out of the holes, but sprayed from the top of the showerhead and ran down the wall. Fortunately, a hand-held alternative (which also had a leak, but could use). The furniture and decor had seen better days. I couldn't shut the window properly (trying to cut out noise) but then opened it again during the night because the room got too hot. The booking message said they were 'refurbishing' and I can only assume my room was still to be done. Someone had spilt a drink and stains on the wall. The cupboard falling to pieces. Coffee and tea bags but no milk or sugar (and empty packets there too). I could have gone downstairs but I was tired and steep stairs. Greeting not rude but not pleasant either - and I've never been told they need to photograph my ID for a UK stay before. Certainly not when booked through Booking.com as my details are known. It was noisy - both the tube (I think - definitely a train) and other guests talking loudly. Bed in room above creaked a lot and you wouldn't want to be there with a child asking what they were doing!!! If you have trouble with stairs, avoid. There are some very steep (uneven) steps up to the front door.
